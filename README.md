# Micromouse-Embedded
Extension of (Micromouse) adds Hardware implementation to the logic algorithms

**PLANS WITH THE CODE**
- Implement the ability to save and load maze configuration from file. + Add color implementation for
added clarity

**HARDWARE**
 ESP32-WROOM-32D (8MB flash) chip --> lightweight, fast, built-in Wifi for easier debugging, ADC, low-power, support both Python and Arduino
 Algorithm switch --> back up in case any algorithm fails
  + Pololu 10:1 Micro Metal Gearmotor HP 6V --> fast, just enough torque, medium power usage, lightweight
  + Pololu Magnetic Encoders for the Micro Metal Gearmotors
  + Pololu Wheel 32Ã—7mm --> featured horizontal treads for improved traction, small and lightweight
  + Voltage Regulator Options:
    ~ 6V Step-up Voltage Regulator --> for the 6V DC Motor above
    ~ Step-down Voltage Regulator --> ESP32 uses 3.3V logic
    ~ Step-Up/Step-Down Voltage Regulator --> maintain a fixed voltage with either lower or higher than expected voltage
  + Tattu 3.7V 800mAh 25C 1S LiPo Battery --> used by Truncale's Micromouse, stable, lightweight, no issue so far
  + PCB design
  + Four wheel configuration, which requires a gear system
  + Reset button for the chip


**3-D printed Chassis**

**NOTE:**
- ESP32 uses 3.3V logic
- Battery is 3.7V. Motors are 6V
